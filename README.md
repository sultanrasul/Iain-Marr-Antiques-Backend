# üè∫ Iain Marr Antiques Inventory & Receipt System (Backend)

Developed end-to-end by **Sultan Rasul**, this backend powers a **full-stack inventory and receipt system** for an antique store.  
The system integrates **Flask**, **Google Sheets API**, and a **USB receipt printer** to replace handwritten receipts with a digital, automated workflow.

## üß† Overview

This backend handles:
- Real-time inventory retrieval and search via Google Sheets API  
- USB receipt printing (112mm) using raw ESC/POS commands and CUPS on a Raspberry Pi  
- Transaction logging into Google Sheets for clean digital records  
- Management endpoints for adding, modifying, or selling products  
- Printer and Raspberry Pi control endpoints (reconnect, shutdown, restart)  

The frontend is built with **Svelte** and communicates with this backend via HTTP requests.

## üè† Google Sheets & Inventory Setup

The backend connects to a **Google Sheet** containing all store stock using a **service account**.  

To use your own sheet for testing or development:

1. Create a **Google service account** and download the JSON key.  
2. Update `SERVICE_ACCOUNT_FILE` in the backend code to point to your key.  
3. Share your sheet with the service account email.  

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Do **not** commit your JSON credentials ‚Äî they must remain private.

## üí∞ Receipt Printing & Automation

- Receipts print to a **112mm USB printer** connected to a Raspberry Pi running Linux CUPS.  
- Header/logo image is printed first, followed by dynamically formatted product lines, totals, and optional customer information.  
- ESC/POS commands are used for text formatting, alignment, and cutting.  
- Transactions are optionally logged into a second sheet automatically, eliminating handwritten records.
