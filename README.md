# üè∫ Iain Marr Antiques Inventory & Receipt System (Backend)

> Developed end-to-end by **Sultan Rasul** as a freelance project for a local antique store.

üîó **Frontend Repository:** [Iain Marr Antiques (Svelte Frontend)](https://github.com/sultanrasul/Iain-Marr-Antiques-Frontend)

## üß© Project Summary

### **Problem**
The store‚Äôs entire sales process was manual ‚Äî handwritten receipts, stock updates in Apple Numbers, and no reliable digital record of transactions.  
There was no way to automatically log sales data or connect receipt printing with inventory management.

### **Solution**
Developed a **Flask-based backend** deployed on a **Raspberry Pi**, responsible for handling all server-side logic and hardware communication.  
Key functionality included:
- Secure **Google Sheets API** integration for retrieving and updating live stock data  
- **ESC/POS thermal printer control** via Linux CUPS to generate branded receipts directly from the POS  
- **Local REST API endpoints** for printing, adding, and modifying inventory, and system management (shutdown/restart)  

### **Impact**
Automated the store‚Äôs entire sales pipeline, transforming a slow, handwritten process into a seamless digital system.  
Reduced transaction time by over 50%, eliminated duplicate record-keeping, and provided reliable, structured data for business tracking.

## üß† Overview

This backend handles:
- Real-time inventory retrieval and search via Google Sheets API  
- USB receipt printing (112mm) using raw ESC/POS commands and CUPS on a Raspberry Pi  
- Transaction logging into Google Sheets for clean digital records  
- Management endpoints for adding, modifying, or selling products  
- Printer and Raspberry Pi control endpoints (reconnect, shutdown, restart)  

The frontend is built with **Svelte** and communicates with this backend via HTTP requests.

## üè† Google Sheets & Inventory Setup

The backend connects to a **Google Sheet** containing all store stock using a **service account**.  

To use your own sheet for testing or development:

1. Create a **Google service account** and download the JSON key.  
2. Update `SERVICE_ACCOUNT_FILE` in the backend code to point to your key.  
3. Share your sheet with the service account email.  

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Do **not** commit your JSON credentials ‚Äî they must remain private.

## üí∞ Receipt Printing & Automation

- Receipts print to a **112mm USB printer** connected to a Raspberry Pi running Linux CUPS.  
- Header/logo image is printed first, followed by dynamically formatted product lines, totals, and optional customer information.  
- ESC/POS commands are used for text formatting, alignment, and cutting.  
- Transactions are optionally logged into a second sheet automatically, eliminating handwritten records.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup Instructions

```bash
# 1. Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# 2. Activate the environment
source venv/bin/activate   # (Linux/Mac)
venv\Scripts\activate      # (Windows)

# 3. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
